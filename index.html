          <p class="description">
            This is a pretty great alternative to something like Steam for hosting your own (mostly) indie games. As a bonus, the website also hosts game jams which you can participate in, where you need to make a game on a given theme over a (relatively short) period of time. I have also used this opportunity to show some of the games that I have made.
